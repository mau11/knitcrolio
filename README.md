## Tech Stack

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, used as the foundation of the frontend.
- **Next.js**: React-based framework for building the frontend and handling server-side logic.
- **TypeScript**: A superset of JavaScript that provides static types and ensures safer, more maintainable code.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for designing responsive, modern interfaces.
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database for storing yarn stash and project data.
- **Prisma**: ORM for interacting with PostgreSQL in a type-safe manner.

## Requirements

- Node v22.14.0
- pnpm v10.10.0

## Development

#### Installing Dependencies

From within the root directory:

```sh
$ nvm use
$ pnpm install
```

#### Set up database

Log into postgres and create new database (replace username with your db username and password with your desired db password):

```
$ psql postgres
postgres=# CREATE DATABASE knitcrolio;
postgres=# \c knitcrolio
knitcrolio=# ALTER USER username WITH PASSWORD 'password';
```

Run the following after making any changes to the schema:

```sh
$ pnpm prisma generate
```

#### Running the Server

Once dependencies are installed, run the following command to start the development server:

```sh
$ pnpm dev
```

Your application will be available at http://localhost:3000.
